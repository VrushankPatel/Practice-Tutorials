 First of all read the nginx.conf and server.js carefully.
 Now, open two cmds or Terminals and bring their path to this folder.
 Now for windows run below command..
    Command prompt 1
    >>> set PORT=3000 && node server.js

    Command prompt 2
    >>> set PORT=3001 && node server.js

For Linux, run below command
    Terminal 1
    >>> PORT=3000 node server.js

    Terminal 2
    >>> PORT=3001 node server.js

Now, server.js is running on two different ports 3000 and 3001, if you've checked the nginx.conf, then you'll understand that how we're going to distribute the load here.
We'll use weighted round robin strategy for load balancing here, we'll keep weight of 3 for port 3000, and 1 or normal for 3001.
So more requests will go to 3000.
Now get nginx or install it, and copy and replace this nginx.conf to your nginx, restart the server and open localhost:8080/hello.
You'll see Hello from port 3000.
Keep reloading the page again and again, and you'll see that in every 4 requests, one is going to 3001.

This is simple load balancing example.
