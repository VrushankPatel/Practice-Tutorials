HAL browser can be used for REST testing, spring boot provides it directly, just we've to add the dependency.
Spring boot actuator can be used to discover all the services or a URLs where all the resources live.
The only thing we did in this project is added the dependency of spring boot actualtor and HAL browser,
simply run this application after adding dependencies,
open the URL of actuator as : localhost:8080
open the URL of HAL browser : http://localhost:8080/browser/index.html#/

if you want the actuator to discover all the services and URLs, then add below line to application.properties
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=*

One more new dependency is spring boot devtools, which allows the developer to run the application with hot reload.
So from now on, if user apply changes in any file of the project, then developer doesn't need to restart the project,
insted, the project will reexecute automatically and the changes will be live easily.
for using devtools, just add the dependency as spring-boot-devtools.
